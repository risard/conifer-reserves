		This file describes the event codes that an ILS method might return.  Not all
		methods will return event codes and it is up to each method to define which
		types of events it may return.  The standard event procedure is to return an
		object (JSON hash) with a field called "ilsevent" which contains the event code
		below.

		If events need to be placed into groups for any reason, the segregation shall
		be defined below with the accompanying events.
