This file describes the event codes that an ILS method might return.  Not all
methods will return event codes and it is up to each method to define which
types of events it may return.  The standard event procedure is to return an
object (JSON hash) with a field called "ilsevent" which contains the event code
below.

If events need to be placed into groups for any reason, the segregation shall
be defined below with the accompanying events.

Events start at 1000
